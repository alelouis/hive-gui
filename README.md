# hive-gui

Godot graphical user interface for my [Hive game engine](https://github.com/alelouis/hive-rust).  
Supposed to be UHP compliant too, but still missing key features.  

Currently the GUI communicates with the engine via a TCP socket, available in Rust on the engine project.  
You need to compile and point towards the TCP server binary in the Server godot node to make this work.
